# Unlocking-Tennis-Data-with-sportsradar-API

The sports industry increasingly relies on data to improve player performance, analyze competitions, and manage events. Tennis, a widely followed sport, generates large amounts of data that, when organized, can reveal trends in rankings, tournaments, and player performance. However, raw sports data from APIs is often messy and hard to analyze.  

This project, **"Game Analytics: Unlocking Tennis Data with SportRadar API,"** simplifies this process. By using **Python** to collect data, **SQL** to store it, and **Streamlit** to create interactive visuals, it turns complex data into an easy-to-use platform for analysts, fans, and event organizers.
